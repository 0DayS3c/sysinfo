             - Featurs in this Tool -

Note: Linux is non userfriendly OS. We can get graphicaly our informations in other OS. like a Windows. But linux users need to type commands for get all of the informations in our system.

> So here the solution:
* I created this automation tool for inux users. all of the users can get user's system informations using this program. You need start the program and you can see your informations. Like: * Date
								    * Time
								    * User informations
								    * System informations and etc....

So Enjoy this. Thanks again for use this. I am Piyusha Akash. Sri Lankan Self studying Junior Cyber security analyst and junior Ethical Hacker.
